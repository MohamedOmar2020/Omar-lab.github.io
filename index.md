# Welcome to the Omar Lab!

<br>
We are part of the [Department of Computational Biomedicine](https://www.cedars-sinai.edu/health-sciences-university/research/departments-institutes/computational-biomedicine.html) and the [Samuel Oschin Comprehensive Cancer Institute](https://www.cedars-sinai.edu/health-sciences-university/research/departments-institutes/cancer.html) at [Cedars-Sinai Medical Center](https://www.cedars-sinai.org/home.html).

Research in the lab is focused on discovering the fundamental principles of macromolecular structure and dynamics.  We are interested in defining conformational states that are essential for function and understanding how conformational transitions couple to biological mechanisms.

We are located in The Green Building of the Pacific Design Center.
