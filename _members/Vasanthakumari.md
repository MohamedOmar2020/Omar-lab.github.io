description: "Priyanka received her Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from Texas A&M University in 2022. Her thesis focused on deep learning-based detection of oral and skin cancer using multi-spectral
Autofluorescence Lifetime Imaging (maFLIM). Subsequently, she joined Argonne National Laboratory as Postdoctoral Fellow, where she focused on developing machine learning models for predicting
anti-cancer drug responses. 


In the Omar lab, Priyanka is working on developing multimodal risk assessment tools for patients with prostate cancer using multiparametric MRI imaging (mpMRI) and digitized histopathology slides of biopsy specimens."
