We are part of the [Department of Computational Biomedicine](https://www.cedars-sinai.edu/health-sciences-university/research/departments-institutes/computational-biomedicine.html) and the [Samuel Oschin Comprehensive Cancer Institute](https://www.cedars-sinai.edu/health-sciences-university/research/departments-institutes/cancer.html)
