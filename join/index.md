## Postdoctoral Fellows

Inquiries about Postdoctoral positions should be emailed directly to [Dr. Mohamed Omar](/contact). We set our minimum postdoctoral fellow compensation to the [NRSA Stipend Levels](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-24-104.html) **and** encourage candidates to explore applying for extramural fellowships to support their research.

## Other Visitors

Interested foreign exchange students, interns, sabbatical visitors from academia and industry are encouraged to reach out directly to [Dr. Mohamed Omar](/contact). We are open to other arrangements as well. As we expect people to be fairly compensated for their work by their home institution or by us, we do not have volunteer positions available. 

**We take undergraduate students exclusively through Cedars-Sinai affiliated programs, e.g. [U-GROW](https://www.csuci.edu/news/spotlights/faculty/u-grow-internship-delacalle.htm)**. This program is a partnership with Cedars-Sinai and eight California State University (CSU) campuses across Southern California. The CSU system is the largest and one of the most diverse undergraduate programs in the United Statesâ€”making it an ideal partner for fostering multicultural talent.
