## Other Visitors

Interested foreign exchange students, interns, sabbatical visitors from academia and industry are encouraged to reach out directly to [Dr. Mohamed Omar](/contact).

**We take undergraduate students exclusively through Cedars-Sinai affiliated programs, e.g. [U-GROW](https://www.csuci.edu/news/spotlights/faculty/u-grow-internship-delacalle.htm)** This program is a partnership with Cedars-Sinai and eight California State University (CSU) campuses across Southern California. The CSU system is the largest and one of the most diverse undergraduate programs in the United Statesâ€”making it an ideal partner for fostering multicultural talent.
